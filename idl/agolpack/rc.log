I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

A previous error seems to have propagated,
causing me to read past where you wanted me to stop.
I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.

! Missing `=' has been inserted.

The next thing in this loop should have been `=' or `:='.
But don't worry; I'll pretend that an equals sign
was present, and I'll look for the values next.

! An expression can't begin with `/'.

I'm afraid I need some sort of value in order to continue,
so I've tentatively inserted `0'. You may want to
delete this zero and insert something else;
see Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.

! Emergency stop.
